Just a way to create a checklist for blogging and make it visible to all your authors on the Edit Post page.

== Description ==

Ever wanted to be able to let your authors know about all of the important steps to remember for your blog? You can distribute another document or use a seperate system, but this very simple plugin lets you define a checklist that will appear on Edit Post page.

Note that other than the design of the checklist, this plugin doesn't store any data. So it's just a way to add some reference material to the Edit Post page.

== Installation ==

It's a pretty easy plugin to use. Just upload it and activate it like any other plugin.
 
== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create a checklist? =

There's a new "Blogging Checklist" menu under the Settings tab. Go there and enter what you want.

= How do I make checkboxes appear? =

Just use a pair of brackets, and they will become checkboxes

= Can I enter HTML? =

Sure, go nuts. Okay, actually be careful. If you leave tags unclosed, you might make the administration pages behave weirdly.

= Security Risks? =

Yes, this plugin does allow you to inject HTML into the Admin pages. However, only an WordPress Administrator can change the checklist, so it's not really a big deal.

= Why doesn't the checklist save its state? =

That's not the point of the plugin. The checklist is just a reference card. The checkboxes are form elements, but these just allow the post author or editor to note which tasks he or she has already completed.

== Screenshots ==

1. Here's what the checklist might look like on a blog post. You can customize it to your heart's content.
2. Here's the admin page. See, easy to modify, no HTML. You can make the checklist as long as you like
